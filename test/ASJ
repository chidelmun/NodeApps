This is the second Android study Jam organised by GDG Buea. We intend to limit the number of students we will be tutoring to a Maximum of 20 so that they are properly mentored by the few mentors (4 for now) we have for the study Jams. There will be a selective process through a Google form which will be used to evaluate applicants skill level before admission into the study Jam. We want Quality apps to be developed not Many apps.
